## Community Ideals

### Inclusivity 
We believe everyone is a valuable contributor to the community regardless of physical or intellectual ability, gender, sexual orientation, physical appearance, race, religion, nationality, language, employment source or status, financial ability, and any other facets of community dynamics not mentioned here. While the community primarily communicates in English at this point, we recognize that it is not the native language for many in the community and strive to express ourselves simply and clearly. We provide opportunities for participation despite challenges of ability, time, geography, finances, etc.

### Collaboration

We collaborate to share the community’s workload and to ensure a variety of needs and voices are accounted for. We do our work as transparently as possible, establishing guidelines for contributing and sharing current and historical community information openly, and welcome new collaborators with enthusiasm.

### Respect

The IIIF community is respectful of and open to differing opinions, viewpoints, experiences, and backgrounds. When we make a mistake we accept responsibility, apologize, and learn from the experience. We give and gracefully accept constructive feedback.

### Greater Good

We do work that benefits the community. We notice, call attention to, and help resolve potential problems. Community members should model good behavior and feel empowered to be [active bystanders](https://www.diglib.org/active-bystander-orientation/) to call out improper behavior and step in to help resolve issues without waiting to escalate to a higher power.


## Unacceptable Behaviors

Participants asked by anyone to stop any harassing behavior must comply immediately. Participants who violate these guidelines by behaving in the following ways will be notified and asked to change their behavior.

-   Physical or verbal harassment or threats directed against another person or group of people
-   Offensive verbal comments, insults, or jokes related to physical or intellectual ability, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, etc.
-   Sexual harassment, including inappropriate or unwanted physical contact, use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
-   Intentional provocation, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
-   Publishing or threatening to publish others’ private information without their explicit permission
-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
-   Advocating for or encouraging any of the above

## Reporting Harassment

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first.

If you are subject to or witness harassment, please contact the Code of Conduct committee at [iiif-conduct@googlegroups.com](mailto:iiif-conduct@googlegroups.com), or individually at in-person events where committee members or event-specific contacts will be identified by badges and introductions at the beginning of the event.

**Written or verbal Code of Conduct reports should include the following information:**
-   Your contact information
-   Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of individuals involved and witnesses
-   When and where the incident occurred (please be as specific as possible)
-   Your account of what occurred. If there is a record available (e.g. a mailing list archive or messages in a Slack channel) please include a link or screenshot.
-   If you believe this incident is or may be ongoing

You will receive an email or verbal confirmation that your report has been received. Within one week you will receive a resolution and course of action or explanation of why the situation is unresolved and continues to be evaluated.
